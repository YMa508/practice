# Actual Interview Questions
Interview questions I've personally experienced.
- [Generic questions](#generic)
- [Company 1](#company-1)
- [Company 2](#company-2)
___
## Generic Questions
1. Explain a related project or role.
2. How did you hear about our company?
3. It looks like most of your experience is in Field X. Why did you apply here?
___
## Company 1

### Phone Screen
1. How would you go about predicting when an event will occur?
2. Given an array with n unordered items, how would you find the b of them closest to a given number x?

### Second Round
1. Write a program that prints out a string representation of a provided integer less than 100,000,000.
2. Write a program that rotates the provided matrix (a list of lists) 90 degrees clockwise.
3. (Standard simple problem with Bayes rule.)
4. Given a time series of measurements A and B, how can you assess whether there is a causal connection from A to B?
5. If X and Y are uncorrelated, and so are X and Z, does that mean that Y and Z are uncorrelated too?
6. What is your favorite ML algorithm, and why?
7. Given a set of 2D points and an input value, calculate the K nearest neighbors to the input value within that set.
8. Given an array of integers and a particular value, find all sets of three integers in that array that sum to that value. Repeats are not allowed.
___
## Company 2

### First Round
1. Given a fair 6-sided die, emulate a fair 5-sided die.
2. Given a fair 6-sided die, emulate a fair 7-sided die.
3. Calculate the average number of rolls required to get your first 4. Don't appeal to any specific named probability distributions.
4. Explain the basis of the logistic regression model.
5. Mathematically, why should we expect the MLE from fitting a logistic regression is any good for prediction on out-of-sample examples?
6. In pure Python, write a histogram calculation function (calculating relative frequencies, not plotting).

### Second Round
1. Write a program to calculate the average of all the numbers seen so far from an infinite sequence of values.
2. Do the same, but calculate the median instead.

### Third Round
1. Describe the random forest algorithm in detail.
2. Given a new feature vector, how does a decision tree make a prediction.
3. What is the benefit of using multiple decision trees in a random forest.
4. Give an example of Bayesian inference.
5. What is an improper prior and why would you use it?
6. If you can't get the posterior distribution analytically, what options do you have?
7. Explace Laplace approximation.
8. Give an example of where Gibbs sampling performs poorly, and describe why.
9. Why might Hamiltonian Monte Carlo perform better?
10. If our catalog contains wooden chairs, wooden tables, metal chairs, and metal tables, what programming structure could you create to store information about these objects.
11. What if the chairs have sepcific chair-only characteristics like "seating height"?
12. What if the catalog has many objects, each potentially with its own special characteristics?

Note that before the third round I was asked to select the three items I feel most comfortable with from a long list of data science topics. I chose:
- Statistical inference and estimation theory
- Graphical models and Bayesian inference
- Decision trees and random forests

The list of topics included items from statistics, machine learning, optimization, mathematics, "big data", and software engineering.
